# Customer-Segmentation-using-K-Means-Clustering
This project uses unsupervised machine learning (K-Means Clustering) to segment customers of a retail store based on their annual income and spending behavior.

---

## Project Objective

To group retail store customers into distinct clusters based on:

-  **Annual Income (k$)**
-  **Spending Score (1–100)**

These insights help businesses implement **targeted marketing** strategies and improve customer experience.

---

## What Makes It Different?

-> Applies **Elbow Method** to find the optimal number of customer clusters
-> Uses only the most **meaningful numerical features** for clustering
-> Integrates **real-time user input** to predict cluster of a new customer
-> Built with a clean pipeline using `scikit-learn` and `matplotlib`

## Dataset Used

-> `Mall_Customers.csv` (200 rows, 5 columns)
-> Features used:
-> `Annual Income (k$)`
-> `Spending Score (1–100)`
